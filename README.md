# Web3_ERC20_mytoken

This project includes a simple React + TypeScript frontend to interact with the ERCâ€‘20 token at `0xd2E83D3b915fa829c5c61c463721FFF2Bc9C09Cf` on the Sepolia network.

## Frontend

The frontend is located in the `frontend` directory and uses Vite. It lets a connected wallet view the token name and current total supply, and mint new tokens.

### Running

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing

There are currently no automated tests. `npm test` simply prints a message.
